Project 4 - 100DaysOfSwiftUI - Days 26-28

** Day 26
 - Creating a ML model using training data & Create ML
** Day 27
 - The name of the .MLmodel file is used for the class name of the model
 - Using the ML model is as simple as calling prediction() with the same type of data for the parameters as used in the training data itself
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
let model = SleepCalculator()
let prediction = try model.prediction(wake: Double(hour + minute), estimatedSleep: sleepAmount, coffee: Double(coffeeAmount))
#+END_SRC
 - And the output name will be a property with the same name as used in the model, and of the same type
 - To generate a Date by supplying only the time, DateComponents() can be used
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
static var defaultWakeTime: Date {
        var components = DateComponents()
        components.hour = 7
        components.minute = 0
        return Calendar.current.date(from: components) ?? Date()
}
#+END_SRC
 - And to extract a particular component from a Date variable (wakeUp below):
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: wakeUp)
let hour = (components.hour ?? 0) * 60 * 60
let minute = (components.minute ?? 0) * 60
#+END_SRC
